# Skipii changes

What each release brings, in a line or two per change, written for the people using the app.
`scripts/publish-apk.sh` posts a version's section as its GitHub release notes, and the app's
What's new sheet (tap Update on Home) shows them before installing.

Add every change someone would notice under **Unreleased**, under `### New`, `### Improved` or
`### Fixed`. Publishing renames Unreleased to the version. Leave out under-the-hood work unless it
changes something people see or feel (faster, fewer errors); then say that.

## Unreleased

## 0.5.75

### New
- Captions. Every track a video has (the creator's, other languages, auto-generated) in ⋮ › Captions in the player's bar, or the CC button on the video and in fullscreen. Auto-generated captions appear word by word as they're said.
- Captions in any language, translated on your phone when the video doesn't have yours (a one-time download of about 30 MB per language, then it works offline).
- Captions turn themselves on when a video isn't in your phone's language. Change that, their look (Skipii, Classic, Outline or Android's own caption settings) and their size in the new Captions card in the account sheet.
- Transcript: every line of a video's captions, under the video like the comments. The line being said lights up as it's said, tap any line to jump there, and search finds a word.
- The bell. Once you're subscribed, a bell sits next to Subscribed (on the video, the channel page and the Shorts channel card). Turn it on and Skipii sends a notification for every new video from that channel; tap one to play it. It's your YouTube account's own bell ("All"), so channels you've already belled in the YouTube app show up within a day, and turning it on here turns it on there.

## 0.5.74

### New
- Hold a finger on the right side of the video to play at 2×, in portrait and fullscreen. Let go and it goes back to the speed it had (a paused video plays while held, then pauses again) (#11, #26, #32, #36, thanks @usa2525-code, @hpqs2024-sys, @ganapathi-subramanian and @jm11x).

### Improved
- Save to playlist opens to the same height as the comments, just under the video, in one smooth motion, and scrolls inside.
- The player's Save (Watch later) button is gone: Watch later is the first row of Playlist.
- Picking a playlist animates (the check pops in), "Saved to …" shows right over the list, and the video above stays bright while it's open.

## 0.5.69

### Fixed
- In fullscreen, Speed opens a small list of speeds under its button, like Quality, instead of a sheet over the whole video. "Every video" at the bottom keeps the speed for every video (#31, thanks @nsk-47).
- Swiping the video down to the mini-player with the comments open now takes the comments along and closes them, instead of leaving them open over the mini-player (#33, thanks @BaooRaami).

## 0.5.68

### New
- Tapping Update now shows what's new in the update first, with the Update button under the list (#30, thanks @usa2525-code).
- Player controls can sit on the video instead of the playback pill (account sheet → Player controls). On the video, the buttons look like the pill's with a round play button, and the video's bottom edge is the progress bar: drag its dot to scrub, with a preview of where you'll land (#28, thanks @BaooRaami).

### Improved
- Fullscreen's controls match the new look: round play button, pill-style buttons, and a slimmer progress bar with gaps between chapters.
- Thumbnails in the feeds are wider, closer to the screen's edge (#27, thanks @nsk-47).
- On narrow phones the channel name gets its own line, so views and upload time are no longer cut off (#27, thanks @BaooRaami).

### Fixed
- In fullscreen, Quality opens a small list under its button instead of a sheet over the whole video (#25, thanks @nsk-47).
